# Udacity-Bertelsmann-Arvato-Capstone
This repository contains:
- My Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Proposal.
- My Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Report.
- My Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Jupiter Notebook containing documented code.

## Code Libraries Used

#### numpy
Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 

#### pandas
Used for data frames and associated opperations. 

#### matplotlib
Used for data visualisation.

#### pickle
Used to save and load data, in this case lists and trained machine learning models. 

#### seaborn
Additional visualizatio tools for matplotlib.

#### sklearn
Comprehensive machinelearning library providing tools for data preparation and processing.

#### imbalanced-learn
Specialized module to adress data imbalance via resampling.

#### xgboost
Extreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm. 
#### sklearn-deap
Used for it's evolutionary grid search algorithm. 

## Data Used
Data used in this project is proprietary and thus not included in this repository.
Exception being the Missing Value Checkbook, which contains only the values for each attribute encoding missing data.
